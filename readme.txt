Project Description:-

The aim of developing an Online Food Ordering System is to replace the traditional way of taking orders with a computerized system. It makes the ordering process 
much easier and provides an efficient customer friendly order management interface. In the present day of the Internet, an Online Food Ordering System becomes 
extremely important to facilitate easy and efficient delivery of food to customers. Not only does it cut down on a lot of middleman charges (e.g. advertising, 
extra payment to delivery men, etc.), it also allows small scale businesses to start operating without very high initial investments. On the customerâ€™s side, it 
makes food ordering an efficient and pleasant experience as they are now able to choose from a variety of options from a large number of restaurants, compare prices 
and order food with the touch of a button!.

Features:-

> This system will enable the administrator to register restaurants, register managers corresponding to the restaurants. 
> The managers will be provided with authentication details by the administrator using which they will be able to login, manage the food items offered by their restaurant, 
  process the orders placed by the customers and change the status of the orders accordingly. 
> Customers will be able to register themselves. Upon login the customers are displayed with a list of restaurants with their ratings.
> Customers will be able to choose the restaurant and place orders containing multiple food items from the same restaurant. Customers will also be able to rate and 
  review their orders upon delivery.
> Customers are provided with their order history which contains current and previously placed orders.
